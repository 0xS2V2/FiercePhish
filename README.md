FiercePhish is a full-fledged phishing framework to manage all phishing engagements.  It allows you to track separate phishing campaigns, schedule sending of emails, and much more. The features will continue to be expanded and will include website spoofing, click tracking, and extensive notification options.

**This is the Version 2 branch which is under _heavy_ development and is NOT recommended for general use yet**
